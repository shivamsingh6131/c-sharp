c# follows 4 fundamental principals.

1) Encalpsulation
2) Inheritance => animal => tiger
3) Abstraction => coffie machine
4) Polymorphism => 1) static/complietime (overloading) 2) dynamic/runtime (latebinding/overriding) 

overRiding => During inheritance in C#, if the same method is present in both the superclass and the subclass. Then, the method in the subclass overrides the same method in the superclass. This is called method overriding.


*Encalpsulation
=> Encalpsulation is defined 'as the process of enclosing one or more items within a physical or logical package'. Encapsulation, in object oriented programming methodology, prevents access to implementation details.
